- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components for better performance and readability
- Implement proper state management using using libraries like Zustand for complex state scenarios
- Utilize React 19's new features like `use` hook for better data fetching and suspense integration
- Ensure proper prop type validation using TypeScript for enhanced type safety
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` selectively for expensive computations or callbacks passed deep into the tree; avoid over-optimizing every function
- Leverage `react-hook-form` for efficient form handling and validation
- Prefer Server Components and data-fetching libraries (like TanStack Query where appropriate) over `useEffect`-driven client-side data loading
- Compose feature components from shared primitives in `src/components/ui` and `src/components/layout` instead of ad-hoc DOM + styling in each page
