- Use Drizzle's type-safe query builder for better code completion and safety.
- Implement migrations using Drizzle Kit for database schema management.
- Utilize Drizzle's relation system to define and query relationships.
- Use Drizzle's transaction API for complex, atomic operations.
- Prefer a code-first migration workflow: treat your TypeScript schema as the source of truth and use `drizzle-kit generate` + `drizzle-kit migrate` to evolve the database schema.
- Avoid applying breaking schema changes directly in production without a corresponding Drizzle migration (or `drizzle-kit push` in controlled non-production environments only).
